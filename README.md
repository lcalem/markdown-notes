This basic server allows to render markdown files in html, packaged into a docker<br/>
Useful when your notes contain images or mathematical stuff<br/>

---

Basic usage for local use:

1 - build the docker with `make docker` <br/>
2 - up it with `make up_server <br/>
3 - open your browser with localhost:3000 <br/>

---

To use an external notes folder<br/>
Mount whatever volume you like in docker/docker-compose.yml
